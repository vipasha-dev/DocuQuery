# DocuQuery
This project is an intelligent chatbot designed to answer questions about uploaded PDFs and documents. The core of the system is an agentic workflow built using LangGraph and its latest concept using memory, which orchestrates a complex interaction between a Large Language Model (LLM) and document data. This goes beyond a simple chat application.
